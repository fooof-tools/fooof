Spectral parameterization (`specparam`, formerly `fooof`) is a fast, efficient, and physiologically-informed tool to parameterize neural power spectra.

WARNING: this Github repository has been updated to a major update / breaking change from the current release of the `fooof` module, and is no longer consistent with the `fooof` version of the code.

Overview
--------

The power spectrum model conceives of a model of the power spectrum as a combination of two distinct functional processes:

- An aperiodic component, reflecting 1/f like characteristics, with
- A variable number of periodic components (putative oscillations), as peaks rising above the aperiodic component

This model driven approach can be used to measure periodic and aperiodic properties of electrophysiological data,
including EEG, MEG, ECoG and LFP data.

The benefit of fitting a model in order to measure putative oscillations, is that peaks in the power spectrum are
characterized in terms of their specific center frequency, power and bandwidth without requiring predefining
specific bands of interest and controlling for the aperiodic component.
The model also returns a measure of this aperiodic components of the signal, allowing for measuring and
comparison of 1/f-like components of the signal within and between subjects.

Dependencies
------------

SpecParam is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.6 to run.

It has the following required dependencies:

- `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_
- `scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_ >= 0.19

There are also optional dependencies, which are not required for model fitting itself, but offer extra functionality:

- `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_ is needed to visualize data and model fits
- `tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`_ is needed to print progress bars when fitting many models
- `pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ is needed for exporting model fit results to dataframes
- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_ is needed to run the test suite locally

We recommend using the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ distribution to manage these requirements.

------------

The current major release is the 1.X.X series, which is a breaking change from the prior 0.X.X series.

Other Language Support
----------------------

The original implementation of `specparam`, available in this repository, is implemented in Python.

If you wish to run specparam from another language, there are a couple potential options:

- a `wrapper`, which allows for running the Python code from another language
- a `reimplementation`, which reflects a new implementation of the specparam algorithm in another language

Below are listed some examples of wrappers and/or reimplementations in other languages (non-exhaustive).

Matlab
~~~~~~

In Matlab, there is a reimplementation available in common toolboxes:
- The `Brainstorm <https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction>`_ toolbox has a reimplementation of specparam (see the `Brainstorm fooof tutorial <https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Fooof>`_)
- The `Fieldtrip <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/>`_ toolbox also uses the same reimplementation (see the `Fieldtrip fooof tutorial <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/example/fooof/>`_)

There is also a Matlab wrapper in the `fooof_mat <http://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof_mat>`_ repository.

Note that another option is to use Python FOOOF within a Matlab pipeline, as explored in the
`mat_py_mat <https://github.com/fooof-tools/mat_py_mat>`_ repository.

Other Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other languages with wrappers include:

- Julia, for which there is a `fooof wrapper <https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/PyFOOOF/Ng8hN/0.1.0>`_
- R, in which fooof can be run using `reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>`_, as `shown here <https://github.com/fooof-tools/DevelopmentalDemo/tree/main/R>`_

Quickstart
----------

This module is object oriented, and uses a similar approach as used in scikit-learn.

The algorithm works on frequency representations, that is power spectra in linear space.

**Fitting a Single Power Spectrum**

With a power spectrum loaded (with 'freqs' storing frequency values, and 'spectrum' storing
the power spectrum, both as 1D arrays in linear space) parameterization can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import the model object
    from specparam import SpectralModel

    # Initialize model object
    fm = SpectralModel()

    # Define frequency range across which to model the spectrum
    freq_range = [3, 40]

    # Parameterize the power spectrum, and print out a report
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum, freq_range)

SpectralModel.report() fits the model, plots the original power spectrum with the associated model fit,
and prints out the parameters of the model fit for both the aperiodic component, and parameters for
any identified peaks, reflecting periodic components.

Example output for the report of a parameterized fit on an individual power spectrum:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fooof-tools/fooof/main/doc/img/FOOOF_report.png

**Defining the model Settings**

The settings for the algorithm are:

* ``peak_width_limits`` sets the possible lower- and upper-bounds for the fitted peak widths.
* ``max_n_peaks`` sets the maximum number of peaks to fit.
* ``min_peak_height`` sets an absolute limit on the minimum height (above aperiodic) for any extracted peak.
* ``peak_threshold`` sets a relative threshold above which a peak height must cross to be included in the model.
* ``aperiodic_mode`` defines the approach to use to parameterize the aperiodic component.

These settings can be defined when initializing the model, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize a model object with defined settings
    fm = SpectralModel(peak_width_limits=[1.0, 8.0], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_height=0.1,
                       peak_threshold=2.0, aperiodic_mode='fixed')

**Fitting a Group of Power Spectra**

Next is an example workflow for fitting a group of neural power spectra.
In this case, 'freqs' is again a 1D array of frequency values, and 'spectra' is a 2D array of power spectra.
We can fit the group of power spectra by doing:

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize a SpectralGroupModel object, specifying some parameters
    fg = SpectralGroupModel(peak_width_limits=[1.0, 8.0], max_n_peaks=8)

    # Fit models across the matrix of power spectra
    fg.fit(freqs, spectra)

    # Create and save out a report summarizing the results across the group of power spectra
    fg.save_report()

    # Save out results for further analysis later
    fg.save(file_name='group_results', save_results=True)

Example output from using SpectralGroupModel across a group of power spectra:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fooof-tools/fooof/main/doc/img/FOOOFGroup_report.png

**Other Functionality**

The module also includes functionality for fitting the model to matrices of multiple power spectra,
saving and loading results, creating reports describing model fits, analyzing model outputs,
plotting models and parameters, and simulating power spectra, all of which is described in the
`documentation <https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/>`_.
