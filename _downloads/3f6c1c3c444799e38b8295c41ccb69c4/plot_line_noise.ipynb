This\napproach simply gets rid of the peaks, interpolating the data to maintain the 1/f\ncharacter of the data, allowing for subsequent fitting.\n\nThe :func:`~fooof.utils.interpolate_spectrum` function allows for doing simple\ninterpolation.

By simply fitting the line noise as peaks, the model can deal\nwith the peaks in order to accurately fit the aperiodic component.\n\nThese peaks are of course not to be analyzed, but once the model has been fit, you can\nsimply ignore them. There should generally be no issue with fitting and having them in\nthe model, and allowing the model to account for these peaks typically helps the model\nbetter fit the rest of the data.\n\nBelow we can see that the model does indeed work when fitting data with line noise peaks.\n\n\n"

        "### The Problem with Bandstop Filtering\n\nA common approach for getting rid of line noise activity is to use bandstop filtering to\nremove activity at the line noise frequencies. Such a filter effectively set the power\nof these frequencies to be approximately zero.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't work very well with spectral parameterization, since the\nparameterization algorithm tries to fit each power value as either part of the aperiodic\ncomponent, or as an overlying peak. Frequencies that have filtered out are neither, and\nthe model has trouble, as it and has no concept of power values below the aperiodic component.\n\nIn practice, this means that the \"missing\" power will impact the fit, and pull down the\naperiodic component. One way to think of this is that the power spectrum model can deal with,\nand even expects, 'positive outliers' above the aperiodic (these are considered 'peaks'), but\nnot 'negative outliers', or values below the aperiodic, as there is no expectation of this\nhappening in the model.\n\nIn the following example, we can see how bandstop filtering negatively impacts fitting.\nBecause of this, for the purposes of spectral parameterization, bandstop filters are not\nrecommended as a way to remove line noise.\n\nNote that if one has already applied a bandstop filter, then you can still\napply the interpolation from above.\n\n\n"
