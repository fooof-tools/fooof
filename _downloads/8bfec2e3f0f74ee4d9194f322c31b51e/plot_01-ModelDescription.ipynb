We use the option\nof adding a knee parameter, since even though neural data is often discussed in terms\nof having `1/f` activity, there is often not a single `1/f` characteristic, especially\nacross broader frequency ranges. Therefore, using this function form allows for modeling\nbends in the power spectrum of the aperiodic component, if and when they occur.\n\nNote that if we were to want the equivalent function in linear power, using $AP$\nto indicate the aperiodic component in linear spacing, it would be:\n\n\\begin{align}AP(F) = 10^b * \\frac{1}{(k + F^\\chi)}\\end{align}\n\n\n"
