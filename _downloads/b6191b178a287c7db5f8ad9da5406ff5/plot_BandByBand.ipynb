        "## Overview\n\nA common analysis approach for investigating neural data is to measure and analyze\nchanges across multiple frequency bands.\n\nThis is typically done using predefined bands, such as:\n\n- delta (1-4 Hz)\n- theta (4-8 Hz)\n- alpha (8-13 Hz)\n- beta (13-30 Hz)\n- gamma (30-50 Hz)\n\nWhen analyzed in this way, and comparing within or between subjects, investigations often\nreport a pattern of changes or differences across bands, for example:\n\n- decreased power in lower frequency bands (delta, theta)\n- increased power in higher frequency bands (beta, gamma)\n\nUnder this framework, each defined band reflects a different entity in the data,\nand the interpretation is typically that there are multiple things changing, with\ncorrelated changes in power across multiple distinct bands.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis for what is changing is that this pattern of results could\nbe driven by changes or differences in the aperiodic component of the data. Changes\nin aperiodic activity, when analyzed in a band-by-band manner, can look like correlated\nchanges across multiple bands.\n\nIn this example, we will use simulated data to examine both the different ways of\nanalyzing such data (band-by-band compared to parameterizing neural power spectra),\nand examine what it looks like if data differs in these hypothesized ways.\nTo do so, we will simulate and analyze data with correlated changes in multiple\ndistinct frequency bands, as well as data in which there is a shift in the aperiodic\ncomponent.\n\n\n"

        "## Conclusion\n\nHere we have investigated changes across power spectra, comparing a 'band-by-band'\napproach to the parameterizing neural power spectra notion of 'periodic & aperiodic'\ncomponents.\n\nWhat we can see is that parameterizing neural power spectra is able to determine\nif changes are driven by differences in oscillatory peaks, and/or by changes in the\naperiodic component of the data.\n\nHowever, we also saw that simply doing a band-by-band power analysis can conflate differences\nfrom aperiodic and periodic changes. Specifically, when we change the aperiodic activity\nin a power spectrum, the band-by-band analysis suggests that multiple distinct frequency\nbands are changing, whereas the more parsimonious (and in the simulated case, the true)\nconclusion should be that changes are driven by changes in the aperiodic activity\nthat affects all frequencies. This also means that if a band-by-band analysis finds\ndifferences across bands, this is not enough to know if there are band-specific changes,\nor aperiodic changes, as this analysis approach does not differentiate the two.\n\nWe conclude here that band-by-band analysis, without measuring or controlling for\naperiodic activity, are ill posed to adjudicate which aspects of the data are changing.\nParameterizing neural power spectra allows for disentangling changes in\nperiodic and aperiodic components of the data.\n\nIn this example, with simulated data, we cannot conclude which changes are more likely\nto be occurring in real data. However, in the real data analysis that this example\nis based on, it was found that a great deal of the changes across development are\ndriven by aperiodic changes, and not by band-by-band differences. This finding\ncame from using the parameterization approach, but was not evidence in prior\nwork using only a band-by-band approach.\nYou can find more on that project\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1101/839258).\n\n\n"
