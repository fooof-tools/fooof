        "## Algorithm Settings\n\nWith default settings, the power spectrum model is relatively minimally constrained. It\ndefaults as such since there are not universal settings that work across all different\nrecording modalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise,\nor effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.\n\nFor any given dataset, you will likely have to tune some of the algorithm settings\nfor optimal performance.\n\nTo do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:\n\n- A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number of peaks you expect to extract\n- Qualitative analysis, guided by examining the the plotted model fit results,\n  as compared to input data\n- Quantitative analysis, considering the model goodness of fit metrics\n  (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting these metrics)\n\nChoosing settings to tune model fitting is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully,\nas assumptions built into the settings chosen will impact the model results. Model\nfitting is generally not overly sensitive to small changes in the settings, so as long\nas broadly appropriate settings are chosen, small perturbations to these chosen settings\nshould not have a large impact on the fitting.\n\nWe do recommend that model settings should not be changed between power spectra\n(across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully compared.\nWe therefore recommend first testing fitting the model across some representative\nspectra, in order to select settings, which you then keep constant for the full analysis.\n\n\n"

        "## Tuning the Algorithm\n\nWith default settings, the model fit is fairly liberal at fitting peaks, and so\nmost commonly this will lead to overfitting, being overzealous at fitting small\nnoisy bumps as peaks.\n\nIn some cases, you may also find you need to relax some settings, to get better fits.\n\nYou also need to make sure you pick an appropriate aperiodic fitting procedure,\nand that your data meets the assumptions of the approach you choose (see the tutorial\non aperiodic fitting).\n\nThe remainder of this notebook goes through some examples of choosing settings\nfor different datasets.\n\n\n"

        "## Interpreting Model Fit Quality Measures\n\nAfter model fitting, some goodness of fit metrics are calculated to assist with assessing\nthe quality of the model fits. It calculates both the model fit error, as the mean absolute\nerror (MAE) between the full model fit (``fooofed_spectrum_``) and the original power spectrum,\nas well as the R-squared correspondence between the original spectrum and the full model.\n\nThese scores can be used to assess how the model is performing. However interpreting these\nmeasures requires a bit of nuance. Model fitting is NOT optimized to minimize fit error /\nmaximize r-squared at all costs. To do so typically results in fitting a large number of peaks,\nin a way that overfits noise, and only artificially reduces error / maximizes r-squared.\n\nThe power spectrum model is therefore tuned to try and measure the aperiodic component\nand peaks in a parsimonious manner, and, fit the `right` model (meaning the right aperiodic\ncomponent and the right number of peaks) rather than the model with the lowest error.\n\nGiven this, while high error / low r-squared may indicate a poor model fit, very low\nerror / high r-squared may also indicate a power spectrum that is overfit, in particular\nin which the peak parameters from the model may reflect overfitting by fitting too many peaks.\n\nWe therefore recommend that, for a given dataset, initial explorations should involve\nchecking both cases in which model fit error is particularly large, as well as when it\nis particularly low. These explorations can be used to pick settings that are suitable\nfor running across a group. There are not universal settings that optimize this, and so\nit is left up to the user to choose settings appropriately to not under- or over-fit\nfor a given modality / dataset / application.\n\n\n"
