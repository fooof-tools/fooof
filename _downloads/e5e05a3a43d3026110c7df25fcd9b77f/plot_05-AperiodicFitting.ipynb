        "Aperiodic Fitting Approaches\n----------------------------\n\nFOOOF currently offers two approaches for fitting the aperiodic component:\n\n- Fitting with just an offset and a exponent, equivalent to a linear fit in log-log space\n\n  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'fixed'\n- Including a 'knee' parameter, reflecting a fit with a bend, in log-log space\n\n  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'knee'\n\nFitting in the 'fixed' mode assumes a single 1/f like characteristic to the aperiodic\nsignal, meaning it looks linear across all frequencies in log-log space.\n\nThough this assumption is true across *some* frequency ranges in neural data, it does\ndoes not hold up across broad freequency ranges. If fitting is done in the 'fixed' mode,\nbut the assumption of a single 1/f is violated, then fitting will go wrong.\n\nBroad frequency ranges (typically ranges greater than ~40 Hz range) don't meet this\ncriterion, as they typically exhibit a 'bend' in the aperiodic signal, whereby there is\nnot a single 1/f property across all frequencies, but rather a 'bend' in the aperiodic\ncomponent. For these cases, fitting should be done using an extra parameter to capture\nthis, in 'knee' mode.\n\n\n"

Becaues of this, when doing knee fits,\nknee & exponent values should be considered together.\n\n\n"

        "Choosing an Aperiodic Fitting Procedure\n---------------------------------------\n\nIt is important to choose the appropriate aperiodic fitting approach for your data.\n\nIf there is a clear knee in the power spectrum, fitting in 'fixed' mode\nwill not work well. However fitting FOOOF with knee fits may perform sub-optimally\nin ambiguous cases (where the data may or may not have a knee), or if no knee is present.\n\nGiven this, we recommend:\n\n- Check your data, across the frequency range of interest,\n  for what the aperiodic signal looks like.\n\n  - If it looks roughly linear (in log-log space), fit without a knee.\n\n    - This is likely across smaller frequency ranges, such as 3-30.\n    - Do not perform no-knee fits across a range in which this does not hold.\n  - If there is a clear knee, then use knee fits.\n\n    - This is likely across larger fitting ranges such as 1-150 Hz.\n- Be wary of ambiguous ranges, where there may or may not be a knee.\n\n  - Trying to fit without a knee, when there is not a single consistent aperiodic signal,\n    can lead to very bad fits. But it is also a known issue that trying to fit with a knee\n    can lead to suboptimal fits when no knee is present.\n\n    - We therefore currently recommend picking frequency ranges in which the expected\n      aperiodic signal process is relatively clear.\n\n\n"
