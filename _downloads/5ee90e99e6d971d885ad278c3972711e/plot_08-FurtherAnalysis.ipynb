        "Exploring Power Spectrum Model Results\n--------------------------------------\n\nSo far we have explored how to parameterize neural power spectra, whereby we can measure\nparameters of interest from data - in particular measuring aperiodic and periodic activity.\n\nThese measured parameters can then be examined within or between groups of interest,\nand/or fed into further analyses. For example, one could examine if these parameters\npredict behavioural or physiological features of interest. Largely, it is up to you what\nto do after fitting power spectrum models, as it depends on your questions of interest.\n\nHere, we briefly introduce some analysis utilities that are included in the module,\nand explore some simple analyses that can be done with model parameters.\n\nTo start, we will load and fit some example data, as well as simulate a group of\npower spectra to fit with power spectrum models, to use as examples for this tutorial.\n\n\n"
