We recommend bandwidths be set to be at last twice\nthe frequency resolution of the power spectrum.\n\nPeak Search Stopping Criteria\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn iterative procedures searches for candidate peaks in the flattened spectrum. Candidate\npeaks are extracted in order of decreasing amplitude, until some stopping criterion is met,\nwhich is controlled by the following parameters:\n\n**max_n_peaks (int)** default: infinite\n\nThe maximum number of peaks that can be extracted from a given power spectrum. FOOOF will\nhalt searching for new peaks when this number is reached. Note that FOOOF extracts peaks\niteratively by amplitude (over and above the aperiodic signal), and so this approach will\nextract (up to) the *n* largest peaks.\n\n**peak_threshold (in units of standard deviation)** default: 2.0\n\nThe threshold, in terms of standard deviation of the aperiodic signal-removed power\nspectrum, above which a data point must pass to be considered a candidate peak.\nOnce a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak search is halted (without\nincluding the most recent candidate).\n\n**min_peak_amplitude (units of power - same as the input spectrum)** default: 0\n\nThe minimum amplitude, above the aperiodic fit, that a peak must have to be extracted\nin the initial fit stage. Once a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak\nsearch is halted (without including the most recent candidate). Note that because\nthis constraint is enforced during peak search, and prior to final peak fit, returned\npeaks are not guaranteed to surpass this value in amplitude.\n\nNote: there are two different amplitude-related halting conditions for the peak searching.\nBy default, the relative (standard-deviation based) threshold is defined, whereas the\nabsolute threshold is set to zero (this default is because there is no general way to\nset this value without knowing the scale of the data). If both are defined, both are\nused and the peak search will halt when a candidate peak fails to pass either the absolute,\nor relative threshold.\n\nAperiodic Signal Fitting Approach\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**aperiodic_mode (string)** default='fixed'\n\nThe fitting approach to use for the aperiodic signal.\n\nOptions:\n  - 'fixed' : fits without a knee parameter (with the knee parameter 'fixed' at 0)\n  - 'knee' : fits the full exponential equation, including the 'knee' parameter\n\nVerbosity\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**verbose (boolean)** default='True'\n\nWhether to print out status updates and warnings.\n\n\n"
