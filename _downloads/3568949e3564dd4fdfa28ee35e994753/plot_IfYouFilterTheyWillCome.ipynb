        "## Filtering Signals\n\nA common component of many analyses of neural time series is to apply filters,\ntypically to try to extract information from frequency bands of interest.\n\nHowever, one thing to keep in mind is that signals with aperiodic activity\nwill always contain power at all frequencies. One of the corollaries of thinking\nof neural signals as containing aperiodic activity, is that there is always power\nwithin any arbitrarily defined frequency range. This power does not necessarily\nentail any periodic activity, but it can look like periodic activity when applying\ntransforms such as narrow-band filters.\n\nIn this notebook we will simulate purely aperiodic signals, and apply filters to\nthem, to explore these ideas.\n\n\n"
