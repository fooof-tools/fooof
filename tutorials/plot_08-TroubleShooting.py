# Algorithm Settings
# ------------------
#
# With default settings, the power spectrum model is relatively minimally constrained. It
# defaults as such since there are not universal settings that work across all different
# recording modalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise,
# or effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.
#
# For any given dataset, you will likely have to tune some of the algorithm settings
# for optimal performance.
#
# To do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:
#
# - A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number of peaks you expect to extract
# - Qualitative analysis, guided by examining the the plotted model fit results,
#   as compared to input data
# - Quantitative analysis, considering the model goodness of fit metrics
#   (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting these metrics)
#
# Choosing settings to tune model fitting is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully,
# as assumptions built into the settings chosen will impact the model results. Model
# fitting is generally not overly sensitive to small changes in the settings, so as long
# as broadly appropriate settings are chosen, small perturbations to these chosen settings
# should not have a large impact on the fitting.
#
# We do recommend that model settings should not be changed between power spectra
# (across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully compared.
# We therefore recommend first testing fitting the model across some representative
# spectra, in order to select settings, which you then keep constant for the full analysis.
#

####################################################################################################
# Tuning the Algorithm
# --------------------
#
# With default settings, the model fit is fairly liberal at fitting peaks, and so
# most commonly this will lead to overfitting, being overzealous at fitting small
# noisy bumps as peaks.
#
# In some cases, you may also find you need to relax some settings, to get better fits.
#
# You also need to make sure you pick an appropriate aperiodic fitting procedure,
# and that your data meets the assumptions of the approach you choose (see the tutorial
# on aperiodic fitting).
#
# The remainder of this notebook goes through some examples of choosing settings
# for different datasets.
#

###################################################################################################
# Interpreting Model Fit Quality Measures
# ---------------------------------------
#
# After model fitting, some goodness of fit metrics are calculated to assist with assessing
# the quality of the model fits. It calculates both the model fit error, as the mean absolute
# error (MAE) between the full model fit (``modeled_spectrum_``) and the original power spectrum,
# as well as the R-squared correspondence between the original spectrum and the full model.
#
# These scores can be used to assess how the model is performing. However interpreting these
# measures requires a bit of nuance. Model fitting is NOT optimized to minimize fit error /
# maximize r-squared at all costs. To do so typically results in fitting a large number of peaks,
# in a way that overfits noise, and only artificially reduces error / maximizes r-squared.
#
# The power spectrum model is therefore tuned to try and measure the aperiodic component
# and peaks in a parsimonious manner, and, fit the `right` model (meaning the right aperiodic
# component and the right number of peaks) rather than the model with the lowest error.
#
# Given this, while high error / low r-squared may indicate a poor model fit, very low
# error / high r-squared may also indicate a power spectrum that is overfit, in particular
# in which the peak parameters from the model may reflect overfitting by fitting too many peaks.
#
# We therefore recommend that, for a given dataset, initial explorations should involve
# checking both cases in which model fit error is particularly large, as well as when it
# is particularly low. These explorations can be used to pick settings that are suitable
# for running across a group. There are not universal settings that optimize this, and so
# it is left up to the user to choose settings appropriately to not under- or over-fit
# for a given modality / dataset / application.
#

###################################################################################################
# Reducing Overfitting
# --------------------
#
# If the model appears to be overfitting (for example, fitting too many peaks to small bumps), try:
#
# - Setting a lower-bound bandwidth-limit, to exclude fitting very narrow peaks, that may be noise
# - Setting a maximum number of peaks that the algorithm may fit: `max_n_peaks`
#
#   - If set, the algorithm will fit (up to) the `max_n_peaks` highest power peaks.
# - Setting a minimum absolute peak height: `min_peak_height`
#

###################################################################################################
# Simulating Power Spectra
# ------------------------
#
# For this example, we will use simulated data. The `specparam` module includes utilities
# for creating simulated power-spectra. To do so, we can use the :func:`~.sim_power_spectrum`
# function to simulate individual power spectra, following the power spectrum model.
#
# First, we will start by simulating a noisy power spectrum.
#

###################################################################################################

# Set the frequency range to simualate the power spectrum
f_range = [1, 50]
# Set aperiodic component parameters, as [offset, exponent]
ap_params = [20, 2]
# Gaussian peak parameters
gauss_params = [[10, 1.0, 2.5], [20, 0.8, 2], [32, 0.6, 1]]
# Set the level of noise to simulate the power spectrum with
nlv = 0.1

# Set random seed, for consistency creating simulated data
set_random_seed(21)

# Create a simulated power spectrum
freqs, spectrum = sim_power_spectrum(f_range, ap_params, gauss_params, nlv)

###################################################################################################

# Fit an (unconstrained) model, liable to overfit
fm = SpectralModel()
fm.report(freqs, spectrum)

###################################################################################################
#
# Notice that in the above fit, we are very likely to think that the model has
# been overzealous in fitting peaks, and is therefore overfitting.
#
# This is also suggested by the model r-squared, which is suspiciously
# high, given the amount of noise we in the simulated power spectrum.
#
# To reduce this kind of overfitting, we can update the algorithm settings.
#

###################################################################################################

# Update settings to fit a more constrained model, to reduce overfitting
fm = SpectralModel(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_height=0.4)
fm.report(freqs, spectrum)

###################################################################################################
#
# We can compare how the model fit, using the updated settings, compares to the
# ground truth of the simulated spectrum.
#
# Note that the simulation parameters are defined in terms of Gaussian parameters,
# which are slightly different from the peak parameters (see the note in tutorial 02),
# which is why we compare to the model gaussian parameters here.
#

###################################################################################################

# Compare ground truth simulated parameters to model fit results
print('Ground Truth \t\t Model Parameters')
for sy, fi in zip(np.array(gauss_params), fm.gaussian_params_):
    print('{:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f} \t {:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f}'.format(*sy, *fi))

###################################################################################################
# Power Spectra with No Peaks
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# A known case in which the model can overfit is in power spectra in which no peaks are
# present. In this case, the standard deviation can be very low, and so the relative
# peak height check (``min_peak_threshold``) is very liberal at keeping gaussian fits.
#
# If you expect, or know, you have power spectra without peaks in your data,
# we recommend using the ``min_peak_height`` setting. Otherwise, the model is unlikely to
# appropriately fit power spectra as having no peaks, since it uses only a relative
# threshold if ``min_peak_height`` is set to zero (which is the default value).
# Setting ``min_peak_height`` requires checking the scale of your power spectra,
# allowing you to define an absolute threshold for extracting peaks.
#

###################################################################################################
# Reducing Underfitting
# ---------------------
#
# If you are finding that the model is underfitting:
#
# - First check and perhaps loosen any restrictions from ``max_n_peaks`` and ``min_peak_height``
# - Try updating ``peak_threshold`` to a lower value
# - Bad fits may stem from issues with aperiodic component fitting
#
#   - Double check that you are using the appropriate aperiodic mode
#
# Next we will simulate a much smoother power spectrum, and update settings accordingly.
#

# Checking Fits Across a Group
# ----------------------------
#
# So far we have explored troubleshooting individual model fits. When starting
# a new analysis, or working with a new dataset, we do recommend starting by
# trying some individual fits like this.
#
# If and when you move to using :class:`~specparam.SpectralGroupModel` to fit groups of power spectra,
# there are some slightly different ways to investigate groups of fits,
# which we'll step through now, using some simulated data.
#

###################################################################################################
# Simulating a Group of Power Spectra
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We will continue using simulated data, this time simulating a group of power spectra.
#
# To simulate a group of power spectra, we will use the :func:`~.sim_group_power_spectra`
# in combination with called :func:`~.param_sampler` that is used to sample across
# possible parameters.
#
# For more and descriptions and example of how the simulations work, check out the
# `examples <https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_examples/index.html>`_ section.
#

###################################################################################################

# Simulation settings for a group of power spectra
n_spectra = 10
sim_freq_range = [3, 50]
nlv = 0.010

# Set the parameter options for aperiodic component and peaks
ap_opts = param_sampler([[20, 2], [50, 2.5], [35, 1.5]])
gauss_opts = param_sampler([[], [10, 0.5, 2], [10, 0.5, 2, 20, 0.3, 4]])

# Simulate a group of power spectra
freqs, power_spectra = sim_group_power_spectra(n_spectra, sim_freq_range,
                                               ap_opts, gauss_opts, nlv)

###################################################################################################

# Initialize a group model object
fg = SpectralGroupModel(peak_width_limits=[1, 6])

###################################################################################################

# Fit power spectrum models and report on the group
fg.report(freqs, power_spectra)

###################################################################################################
#
# In the :class:`~specparam.SpectralGroupModel` report we can get a sense of the overall performance
# by looking at the information about the goodness of fit metrics, and also things like
# the distribution of peaks.
#
# However, while these metrics can help identify if fits are, on average, going well (or not)
# they don't necessarily indicate the source of any problems.
#
# To do so, we will typically still want to visualize some example fits, to see
# what is happening. To do so, next we will find which fits have the most error,
# and select these fits from the :class:`~specparam.SpectralGroupModel` object to visualize.
#

###################################################################################################

# Find the index of the worst model fit from the group
worst_fit_ind = np.argmax(fg.get_params('error'))

# Extract this model fit from the group
fm = fg.get_model(worst_fit_ind, regenerate=True)

###################################################################################################

# Check results and visualize the extracted model
fm.print_results()
fm.plot()

###################################################################################################
#
# You can also loop through all the results in a :class:`~specparam.SpectralGroupModel`, extracting
# all fits that meet some criterion that makes them worth checking.
#
# This might be checking for fits above some error threshold, as below, but note
# that you may also want to do a similar procedure to examine fits with the lowest
# error, to check if the model may be overfitting, or perhaps fits with a particularly
# large number of gaussians.
#

###################################################################################################

# Extract all fits that are above some error threshold, for further examination.
#  You could also do a similar analysis for particularly low errors
error_threshold = 0.010
to_check = []
for ind, res in enumerate(fg):
    if res.error > error_threshold:
        to_check.append(fg.get_model(ind, regenerate=True))

# A more condensed version of the procedure above can be written like this:
#to_check = [fg.get_model(ind, True) for ind, res in enumerate(fg) if res.error > error_threshold]

###################################################################################################

# Loop through the problem fits, checking the plots, and saving out reports, to check later.
for ind, fm in enumerate(to_check):
    fm.plot()
    fm.save_report('Report_ToCheck_#' + str(ind))

###################################################################################################
#
# Another thing that can be worth keeping an eye on is the average number of fit
# peaks per model. A particularly high value can indicate overfitting.
#

###################################################################################################

# Check the average number of fit peaks, per model
print('Average number of fit peaks: ', np.mean(fg.n_peaks_))

###################################################################################################
# Reporting Bad Fits
# ------------------
#
# If, after working through these suggestions, you are still getting bad fits, and/or
# are just not sure what is going on, please get in touch! We will hopefully be able to
# make further recommendations, and this also serves as a way for us to investigate when
# and why model fitting fails, so that we can continue to make it better.
#
# You can report issues on Github `here <https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof>`.
#
# There is also a helper method to print out instructions for reporting
# bad fits / bugs back to us, as demonstrated below.
#

###################################################################################################

# Print out instructions to report bad fits
#  Note you can also call this from SpectralGroupModel, and from instances (ex: `fm.print_report_issue()`)
SpectralModel.print_report_issue()
