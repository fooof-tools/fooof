Rhythmicity of Time Series
==========================

Exploring the rhythmicity of time series and their frequency representations.

Rhythmicity of Time Series
--------------------------

Central to the motivation for parameterizing neural power is the claim that power at a
given frequency is not sufficient to claim that there is evidence for rhythmic, or
periodic, activity at that frequency.

In this example, we will explore this idea by examining some example signals in the
time domain, and their frequency domain representations. We will use these signals to
motivate if and when signals should be interpreted as containing periodic activity.


The Fourier Theorem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stated informally, the Fourier theorem tells us that any time series can be represented
as a sum of sinusoids.

This is a powerful and useful theorem, as it means that we can use tools such as the
Fourier transform and other similar measures, to compute frequency representations
of any time series data.

However, just because a signal _can_ be represented by sinusoids does not mean that any
given signal, or any given aspect of a signal, for which a power spectrum can be computed
should be conceptualized as being comprised of rhythmic components.

The power spectrum is just a possible representation of the original data, not a
descriptive claim of the actual components of the data.

    s_rate = 1000

    # Compute a times vector, for plotting, and check length of data
    times = create_times(n_seconds, s_rate)
    n_points = len(times)








Frequency Representations of Aperiodic Signals
----------------------------------------------

Let's start with aperiodic signals, and examine how different types of aperiodic
signals are represented in the frequency domain.


The Dirac Delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dirac delta is arguably the simplest signal, as it's a signal of all zeros,
except for a single value of 1.



.. code-block:: default


    # Simulate a delta function
    dirac_sig = np.zeros([n_points])
    dirac_sig[500] = 1









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the time series of the delta signal
    plot_time_series(times, dirac_sig)

    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Next, lets compute the frequency representation of the delta function.



.. code-block:: default


    # Compute a power spectrum of the Dirac delta
    freqs, powers = compute_spectrum_welch(dirac_sig, 100)









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the power spectrum of the Dirac delta
    plot_power_spectra(freqs, powers)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Section Conclusions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we can see above, the power spectrum of the Dirac delta function has
power across all frequencies.

This is despite it containing containing a single non-zero value, and thus having
no rhythmic properties to it in the time domain.

The Dirac delta example can be taken as a proof of principle that observing power
at a particular frequency does not necessarily imply that one should consider that
there are any rhythmic properties at that frequency in the original time series.

In this case, and many like it, power across all frequencies is a representation of
transient (or aperiodic) activity in the time series. Broadly, when there are transients,
or aperiodic components, lots of sinusoids have to added together in order to represent
aperiodic activity out of a basis set of periodic sine waves, and this is why such
signals typically look very broadband in the frequency domain.


Coloured Noise Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's now look at 'noise' signals.

In the signals below, we will simulate coloured noise signals, in which samples are
drawn randomly from noise distributions, with no rhythmic properties.

As we will see, in the power spectrum, these signals exhibit power at all frequencies,
with specific patterns of powers across frequencies, which is dependent on the 'colour'
of the noise.


White Noise
^^^^^^^^^^^

A 'white noise' signal is one that is generated with uncorrelated samples drawn from
a random distribution. Since each element of the signal is sampled randomly,
there is no consistent rhythmic structure in the signal.



.. code-block:: default


    # Generate a white noise time series signal
    white_sig = np.random.normal(0, 1, n_points)









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the white noise time series
    plot_time_series(times, white_sig)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_003.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





As before, we can compute and visualize the power spectrum of this signal.



.. code-block:: default


    # Compute the power spectrum of the white noise signal
    freqs, powers = compute_spectrum_welch(white_sig, s_rate)









.. code-block:: default


    # Visualize the power spectrum of the white noise signal
    plot_power_spectra(freqs, powers)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_004.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





In the frequency representation, we can see that white noise has a flat power spectrum,
with equal power across all frequencies. This is the definition of white noise.

This is similar to the delta function, though note that in this case the power across
frequencies is representing continuous aperiodic activity, rather than a single transient.


Pink Noise
^^^^^^^^^^

Other 'colors' of noise refer to different patterns of power distributions
in the power spectrum.

For example, pink noise is a signal where power systematically decreases across
frequencies in the power spectrum.



.. code-block:: default


    # Generate a pink noise signal
    pink_sig = sim.sim_powerlaw(n_seconds, s_rate, exponent=-1)









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the pink noise time series
    plot_time_series(times, pink_sig)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_005.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img






.. code-block:: default


    # Compute the power spectrum of the pink noise signal
    freqs, powers = compute_spectrum_welch(pink_sig, s_rate)









.. code-block:: default


    # Visualize the power spectrum of the pink noise signal
    plot_power_spectra(freqs, powers)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_006.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Section Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'coloured noise' signals above are simulated signals with no rhythmic properties,
in the sense that there are no characteristic frequencies or visible rhythms in the data.

Nevertheless, and by definition, in the power spectra of such signals, there is power across
all frequencies, with some pattern of power across frequencies.

However, there are no frequencies at which power is different from expected from an
aperiodic noise signal. These signals are statistically, by definition, aperiodic.


Frequency Representations of Rhythmic Signals
---------------------------------------------

Next, lets check what frequency representations look like for time series that do have
rhythmic activity.


Sinusoidal Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many different rhythmic signals we could simulate, in terms of different
rhythmic shapes, and or temporal properties (such as rhythmic bursts). For this
example, we will stick to simulating continuous sinusoidal signals.



.. code-block:: default


    # Generate an oscillating signal
    osc_sig = sim.sim_oscillation(n_seconds, s_rate, freq=10)









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the oscillating time series
    plot_time_series(times, osc_sig)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_007.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img






.. code-block:: default


    # Compute the power spectrum of the oscillating signal
    freqs, powers = compute_spectrum_welch(osc_sig, s_rate)









.. code-block:: default


    # Visualize the power spectrum of the oscillating signal
    plot_power_spectra(freqs, powers)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_008.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Section Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there is rhythmic activity at a particular frequency, this exhibits as a 'peak'
of power in the frequency domain. This peak indicates high power at a specific frequency,
where as the power values at all other frequencies are effectively zero.


Frequency Representations of Complex Signals
--------------------------------------------

Now let's consider the case whereby one could have a signal comprised of multiple
components, for example one or more oscillations combined with an aperiodic component.


Combined Aperiodic & Periodic Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To examine this, we will simulate combined signals, comprising both periodic and aperiodic
components, and see what the frequency representations look like.



.. code-block:: default


    # Define component of a combined signal: an oscillation and an aperiodic component
    components = {
        'sim_oscillation' : {'freq' : 10},
        'sim_powerlaw' : {'exponent' : -1}
    }

    # Generate a combined signal
    combined_sig = sim.sim_combined(n_seconds, s_rate, components)









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot the combined time series
    plot_time_series(times, combined_sig)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_009.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img






.. code-block:: default


    # Compute the power spectrum of the combined signal
    freqs, powers = compute_spectrum_welch(combined_sig, s_rate)









.. code-block:: default


    # Visualize the power spectrum of the combined signal
    plot_power_spectra(freqs, powers)




.. image:: /auto_motivations/concepts/images/sphx_glr_plot_DoYouEvenOscillate_010.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Section Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the power spectrum above, we can see that combined signals, with aperiodic & periodic
activity reflect elements of both components. The periodic power can be seen as a
peak of power over and above the rest of the spectrum, at the frequency of the simulated
rhythm. Across all frequencies, we also see the power contributed by the aperiodic component.


Conclusion
----------

In this example, we have seen that, in the frequency domain:

- transients and aperiodic activity exhibit power across all frequencies
- oscillations exhibit specific power, or a 'peak', at the frequency of the rhythm
- combined signals display a combination of these properties, with power
  across all frequencies, and overlying 'peaks' at frequencies with periodic activity

Collectively, we have seen cases that motivate that simply having power at a particularly
frequency does not imply any rhythmic component at that frequency. Peaks of frequency specific
power are associated with rhythmic activity in the time series.

What we have covered here are just a starting point for some properties of time
series analysis and digital signal processing. For neural data, these properties alone
do not tell us how to interpret neural power spectra. However, here we take them as a
starting point that motivate why prominent rhythms in the time series can be measured
as peaks in the power spectrum, but that absent a peak, we should not automatically
interpret power at any given frequency as necessarily reflecting rhythmic activity.
