Manipulating FOOOF Objects
==========================

Examples with combining, sub-selecting, dropping, and averaging FOOOF model fits.

As you run FOOOF analyses, you may end up with multiple FOOOF objects, as you fit
models within and across subjects, conditions, trials, etc. To help manage and organize
the potentially multiple FOOOF objects that can arise in these cases, here we will
explore the utilities offered for managing and organizing within and between FOOOF
objects.

Using simulated data, in this example we will cover:

- combining results across FOOOF objects
- sub-selecting fits from FOOOFGroup objects
- dropping specified model fits from FOOOFGroup objects
- average across groups of FOOOF fits



.. code-block:: default


    # Import FOOOF & FOOOFGroup objects
    from fooof import FOOOF, FOOOFGroup

    # Import Bands object, to manage frequency band definitions
    from fooof.bands import Bands

    # Import utility functions that manage & manipulate FOOOF objects
    from fooof.objs.utils import average_fg, combine_fooofs, compare_info

    # Import simulation functions to create our example data
    from fooof.sim.gen import gen_power_spectrum
    from fooof.sim.params import param_sampler








First, we will simulate some example data, and fit some individual fits with FOOOF objects.



.. code-block:: default


    # Settings for simulations
    freq_range = [1, 50]
    freq_res = 0.25

    # Create some example power spectra
    freqs, powers_1 = gen_power_spectrum(freq_range, [0, 1.0], [10, 0.25, 2],
                                         nlv=0.00, freq_res=freq_res)
    freqs, powers_2 = gen_power_spectrum(freq_range, [0, 1.2], [9, 0.20, 1.5],
                                         nlv=0.01, freq_res=freq_res)
    freqs, powers_3 = gen_power_spectrum(freq_range, [0, 1.5], [11, 0.3, 2.5],
                                         nlv=0.02, freq_res=freq_res)









.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize a set of FOOOF objects
    fm1, fm2, fm3 = FOOOF(max_n_peaks=4), FOOOF(max_n_peaks=4), FOOOF(max_n_peaks=4)

    # Fit FOOOF models
    fm1.fit(freqs, powers_1)
    fm2.fit(freqs, powers_2)
    fm3.fit(freqs, powers_3)








Combining FOOOF Objects
-----------------------

Sometimes, when working with models in :obj:`FOOOF` or :obj:`FOOOFGroup` objects,
you may want to combine them together, to check some group properties.

The :func:`combine_fooofs` function takes a list of FOOOF and/or FOOOFGroup objects,
and combines all available fits together into a FOOOFGroup object.

Let's now combine our individual model fits into a FOOOFGroup object.



.. code-block:: default


    # Combine FOOOF a list of FOOOF objects into a FOOOFGroup object
    fg = combine_fooofs([fm1, fm2, fm3])

    # Check the number of models in the object
    #   Note that the length of a FOOOFGroup object is defined as the number of model fits
    print('Number of model fits: ', len(fg))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of model fits:  3




Note on Manipulating FOOOF Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that these functions that manipulate FOOOF object typically do more than just
copying result data - they also check and manage settings and meta-data of objects.

For example, combining FOOOF objects returns a new FOOOF object with the same settings.

We can see this by using the :func:`compare_info` function to compare the settings
between FOOOF objects.

You can also use this function if you wish to compare FOOOF objects to
ensure that you are comparing model results that were fit with equivalent settings.



.. code-block:: default


    # Compare FOOOF objects for if they have the same settings
    compare_info([fm1, fg], 'settings')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    True



Sub-Select from FOOOFGroup
--------------------------

When you have a FOOOFGroup object, you may also want to sub-select a group of models.

Example use cases for this could be:

- you want to sub-select models that meet some kind of goodness-of-fit criterion
- you want to examine a subset of model reflect, for example, particular channels or trials

To do so, we can use the :func:`get_group` method of the FOOOFGroup object.
This method takes in an input specifying which indices to sub-select, and returns a
new FOOOFGroup object, containing only the requested model fits.

Note that if you want to sub-select a single FOOOF model you can
use the :func:`get_fooof` method.



.. code-block:: default


    # Define indices of desired sub-selection of model fits
    #   This could be a the indices for a 'region of interest', for example
    inds = [0, 1]

    # Sub-select our selection of models from the FOOOFGroup object
    nfg = fg.get_group(inds)

    # Check how many models our new FOOOFGroup object contains
    print('Number of model fits: ', len(nfg))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of model fits:  2




From here, we could continue to do any analyses of interest on our new
FOOOFGroup object, which contains only our models of interest.


Dropping Fits from FOOOFGroup
-----------------------------

Another option is to 'drop' model fits from a FOOOFGroup object. You can do this with
the :func:`drop` method from a :obj:`FOOOFGroup` object.

This can be used, for example, for a quality control step. If you have checked through
the object, and noticed some outlier model fits, you may want to exclude them from
future analyses.

In this case, we'll use an example in which we drop any model fits that
have particularly high error.



.. code-block:: default


    # Drop all model fits above an error threshold
    fg.drop(fg.get_params('error') > 0.01)








Note on Dropped or Failed Fits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When models are dropped from :obj:`FOOOFGroup` objects, they are set as null models.
They are therefore cleared of results, but not literally dropped, which
is done to preserve the ordering of the FOOOFGroup, so that the `n-th` model
doesn't change if some models are dropped.

Note that there may in some cases be Null models in a FOOOFGroup without
explicitly dropping them, if any models failed during the fitting process.



.. code-block:: default


    # Check information on null models (dropped models)
    print('Number of Null models  : \t', fg.n_null_)
    print('Indices of Null models : \t', fg.null_inds_)

    # Despite the dropped model, the total number of models in the object is the same
    #   This means that the indices are still the same as before dropping models
    print('Number of model fits: ', len(fg))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of Null models  :         1
    Indices of Null models :         [2]
    Number of model fits:  3





.. code-block:: default


    # Null models are defined as all NaN (not a number)
    for ind in fg.null_inds_:
        print(fg[ind])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    FOOOFResults(aperiodic_params=array([nan, nan]), peak_params=array([], shape=(0, 3), dtype=float64), r_squared=nan, error=nan, gaussian_params=array([], shape=(0, 3), dtype=float64))




Note on Selecting From FOOOF Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the :func:`get_group` and :func:`drop` methods take an input of the indices
of FOOOF model to select or drop.

In both cases, the input can be defined in multiple ways, including directly indicating
the indices as a list of integers, or boolean masks.


Averaging FOOOFGroup
--------------------

Finally, let's average across the models in our FOOOFGroup object, to examine
the average model of the data.

Note that in order to be able to average across individual models, we need to define
a set of frequency bands to average peaks across. Otherwise, there is no clear way
to average across all the peaks across all models.



.. code-block:: default


    # Define the periodic band regions to use to average across
    #   Since our simulated data only had alpha peaks, we will only define alpha here
    bands = Bands({'alpha': [7, 14]})

    # Average across individual models fits, specifying bands and an averaging function
    afm = average_fg(fg, bands, avg_method='median')

    # Plot our average model of the data
    afm.plot()
