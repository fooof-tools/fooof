Failed Model Fits
=================

Example of model fit failures and how to debug them.


.. code-block:: default


    # Import the FOOOFGroup object
    from fooof import FOOOFGroup

    # Import simulation code to create test power spectra
    from fooof.sim.gen import gen_group_power_spectra

    # Import the FOOOF FitError, which we will use to help debug model fit errors
    from fooof.core.errors import FitError








Model Fit Failures
------------------

The FOOOF model is not guaranteed to fit - sometimes the fit procedure can fail.

Model fit failures are rare, and they typically only happen on spectra that are
particular noisy, and/or are some kind of outlier for which the fitting procedure
fails to find a good model solution.

In general, model fit failures should lead to a clean exit, meaning that
a failed model fit does not lead to a code error. The failed fit will be encoded in
the results as a null model, and the code can continue onwards.

In this example, we will look through what it looks like when model fits fail.



.. code-block:: default


    # Simulate some example power spectra to use for the example
    freqs, powers = gen_group_power_spectra(25, [1, 50], [1, 1], [10, 0.25, 3],
                                            nlvs=0.1, freq_res=0.25)









.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize a FOOOFGroup object, with some desired settings
    fg = FOOOFGroup(min_peak_height=0.1, max_n_peaks=6)









.. code-block:: default


    # Fit power spectra
    fg.fit(freqs, powers)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Running FOOOFGroup across 25 power spectra.




If there are failed fits, these are stored as null models.

Let's check if there were any null models, from model failures, in the models
that we have fit so far. To do so, the :obj:`FOOOFGroup` object has some attributes
that provide information on any null model fits.

These attributes are:

- `n_null_` : the number of model results that are null
- `null_inds_` : the indices of any null model results



.. code-block:: default


    # Check for failed model fits
    print('Number of Null models  : \t', fg.n_null_)
    print('Indices of Null models : \t', fg.null_inds_)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of Null models  :         0
    Indices of Null models :         []




Inducing Model Fit Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, we have no model failures (as is typical).

For this example, to induce some model fits, we will use a trick to change the number of
iterations the model uses to fit parameters (`_maxfev`), making it much more likely to fail.

Note that in normal usage, you would likely never want to change the value of `_maxfev`,
and this here is a 'hack' of the code in order to induce reproducible failure modes
in simulated data.



.. code-block:: default


    # Hack the FOOOf object to induce model failures
    fg._maxfev = 50









.. code-block:: default


    # Try fitting again
    fg.fit(freqs, powers)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Running FOOOFGroup across 25 power spectra.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.
    Model fitting was unsuccessful.




As we can see, there are now some model fit failures! Note that, as above, FOOOF
will print out if there is as model fit failure when in verbose mode.



.. code-block:: default


    # Check how many model fit failures we have failed model fits
    print('Number of Null models  : \t', fg.n_null_)
    print('Indices of Null models : \t', fg.null_inds_)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of Null models  :         6
    Indices of Null models :         [8, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24]




Debug Mode
----------

There are multiple possible reasons why a model fit failure can occur, or at least
multiple possible steps in the algorithm at which the fit failure can occur.

If you have a small number of fit failures, you can likely just exclude them.

However, if you have multiple fit failures, and/or you want to investigate why the
model is failing, you can use the debug mode to get a bit more information about
where the model is failing.

The debug mode will stop the FOOOF object catching and continuing any model
fit errors, allowing you to see where the error is happening, and get more
information about where it is failing.

Note that here we will run the fitting in a try / except to catch the error and
print it out, without the error actually being raised (for website purposes).
If you just want to see the error, you can run the fit call without the try/except.



.. code-block:: default


    # Set FOOOFGroup into debug mode
    fg.set_debug_mode(True)









.. code-block:: default


    # Refit in debug mode, in which failed fits will raise an error
    try:
        fg.fit(freqs, powers)
    except FitError as fooof_error:
        print(fooof_error)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Running FOOOFGroup across 25 power spectra.
    Model fitting failed due to not finding parameters in the peak component fit.




Debugging Model Fit Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This debug mode should indicate in which step the model is failing, which might indicate
what features of the data to look into, and/or which settings to try and tweak.

Also, all known model fit failures should be caught by the object, and not raise an
error (when not in debug mode). If you are finding examples in which the model is failing
to fit, and raising an error (outside of debug mode), then this might be an unanticipated
issue with the model fit.

If you are unsure about why or how the model is failing to fit, consider
opening an `issue <https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof/issues>`_ on the project
repository, and we will try to look into what seems to be happening.
