06: FOOOFGroup
==============


This tutorial covers running FOOOF across multiple power spectra, using FOOOFGroup.




.. code-block:: python


    # FOOOF imports: import FOOOFGroup object
    from fooof import FOOOFGroup

    # Import some utilities for synthesizing some test data
    from fooof.synth.params import param_sampler
    from fooof.synth.gen import gen_group_power_spectra







Synthesizing Power Spectra
--------------------------

FOOOF includes some support for creating synthetic power-spectra, that mimic real data.

Here we will use that functionality to create a matrix of power spectra to test with.

Here we will use a helper function called :func:`param_sampler` that takes a
list of possible parameters, and creates an object that randomly samples from
them to generate power spectra.

If you would like to generate single power spectra, you can use :func:`gen_power_spectrum`,
also in `fooof.synth.gen`.




.. code-block:: python


    # Settings for synthesizing power spectra
    n_spectra = 10
    f_range = [3, 40]

    # Set some options for background parameters
    #  Generated spectra will have an offset of either [20, 50, 35], and exponent of [2., 2.5, 1.5]
    ap_opts = param_sampler([[20, 2], [50, 2.5], [35, 1.5]])

    # Set some options for peak parameters
    #  Generated power spectra will have either no peaks, a 10 Hz peak, or a 10 Hz & 20 Hz peak
    gauss_opts = param_sampler([[], [10, 0.5, 2], [10, 0.5, 2, 20, 0.3, 4]])







We can now feed these settings into :func:`gen_group_power_spectra`,
that will generate a group of power spectra for us.

Note that this function also returns a list of the parameters
used to generate each power spectrum.




.. code-block:: python


    # Generate the group of synthetic spectra
    #  Note that this function also returns a list of the parameters for each func
    freqs, spectra, syn_params = gen_group_power_spectra(n_spectra, f_range, ap_opts, gauss_opts)







FOOOFGroup
----------

The FOOOFGroup object is very similar to the FOOOF object (programmatically, it inherits
from the FOOOF object), and can be used in the same way.

The main difference is that instead of running across a single power spectrum, it
operates across 2D matrices containing multiple power spectra.

Note that by 'group' we mean merely to refer to a group of power-spectra,
not necessarily to a group in terms of multiple subjects or similar.
Most likely, a FOOOFGroup will be run across a collection of spectra from across
channels, and/or across trials, within or across subjects.

The main difference with the FOOOFGroup object, is that it also contains a
`power_spectra` attribute, which stores the matrix of power-spectra to be fit,
and collects fit results into a `group_results` attribute.

Otherwise, FOOOFGroup supports all the same functionality,
accessed in the same way as the FOOOF object.

Internally, it runs the exact same fitting procedure, per spectrum, as the FOOOF object.




.. code-block:: python


    # Initialize a FOOOFGroup object - it accepts all the same settings as FOOOF
    fg = FOOOFGroup(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], min_peak_amplitude=0.05, max_n_peaks=6)








.. code-block:: python


    # Fit a group of power spectra with the .fit() method
    #  The key difference (compared to FOOOF) is that it takes a 2D array of spectra
    #     This matrix should have the shape of [n_spectra, n_freqs]
    fg.fit(freqs, spectra)

Just as with the FOOOF object, you can call the convenience method `report` to run
the fitting, and print results & plots, printing out the same as above.

FOOOFGroup Data
---------------

FOOOFGroup collects fits across power spectra into a list of FOOOFResults objects.




.. code-block:: python


    # As it runs, FOOOFGroup collects each fit results in 'group_results'
    #  `group_results` is a list of FOOOFResult objects
    print(fg.group_results[0:2])

get_all_data
------------

To collect data across all model fits, and to select specific data results from this data
you can use the :func:`get_all_data` method. This method lets you extract specific results
by specifying a field, as a string, and (optionally) a specific column of that data, also
as a string (or, optionally, as an integer index).




.. code-block:: python


    # Extract aperiodic data
    aps = fg.get_all_data('aperiodic_params')
    exps = fg.get_all_data('aperiodic_params', 'exponent')

    # Extract peak data
    peaks = fg.get_all_data('peak_params')
    cfs = fg.get_all_data('peak_params', 'CF')

    # Extract metadata about the model fit
    errors = fg.get_all_data('error')
    r2s = fg.get_all_data('r_squared')








.. code-block:: python


    # The full list of data you can specify is available in the documentation of :func:`get_all_data`
    print(fg.get_all_data.__doc__)

More information about the data you can extract is also documented in the FOOOFResults object

Saving & Loading with FOOOFGroup
--------------------------------

FOOOFGroup also support saving and loading, with same options as saving from FOOOF.

The only difference in saving FOOOFGroup, is that it saves out a 'jsonlines' file,
in which each line is a JSON object, saving the specified data and results for
a single power spectrum.

Note that saving settings together with results will save out duplicated settings
to each line in the output file, corresponding to each individual spectrum in the group,
and so is somewhat inefficient. It is more parsimonious to save out a single settings file,
and a separate file that includes the results.




.. code-block:: python


    # Save out FOOOFGroup settings & results (separately)
    fg.save('FG_settings', save_settings=True)
    fg.save('FG_results', save_results=True)








.. code-block:: python


    # You can then reload this group data
    nfg = FOOOFGroup()
    nfg.load('FG_results')

    ==================================================================================================


Parallel Support
----------------

FOOOFGroup also has support for running in parallel, which can speed things up as
each power spectrum is fit independently.

The fit method includes an optional parameter 'n_jobs', which if set at 1 (as default),
will run FOOOF linearly. If you set this parameter to some other integer, fitting will
launch 'n_jobs' number of jobs, in parallel. Setting n_jobs to -1 will launch in
parallel across all available cores.

Note, however, that running FOOOF in parallel does not gaurantee a quicker runtime overall.
The computation time per FOOOF-fit scales with the frequency range fit over, and the
'complexity' of the power spectra, in terms of number of peaks. For relatively small
numbers of power spectra (less than ~100), across relatively small frequency ranges
(say ~3-40Hz), running in parallel may offer no appreciable speed up.

Extacting Individual Fits
-------------------------

When running FOOOF across a group of power spectra, results are stored as the FOOOFResults,
which stores (only) the results of the model fit, not the full model fits themselves.

To examine individual model fits, FOOOFGroup can regenerate FOOOF objects for individual
power spectra, with the full model available for visualization.




.. code-block:: python


    # Extract a particular spectrum, specified by index to a FOOOF object
    #  Here we also specify to regenerate the the full model fit, from the results
    fm = fg.get_fooof(ind=2, regenerate=True)








.. code-block:: python


    # Print results and plot extracted FOOOF model fit
    fm.print_results()
    fm.plot()
