04: Exploring the FOOOF Object
==============================

Further exploring the FOOOF object, including algorithm settings and available methods.


.. code-block:: default


    # Import numpy for loading data
    import numpy as np

    # Import the FOOOF object
    from fooof import FOOOF









.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize a FOOOF object, to use to explore
    fm = FOOOF()








Description of FOOOF methods and parameters
-------------------------------------------

The FOOOF object contents consist of 4 main components (groups of data / code):

- 1) settings attributes, that control the algorithm fitting
- 2) data attributes, that contain and describe the data
- 3) result attributes, that contain the results of the model fit
- 4) methods (functions) that perform procedures for fitting models and associated utilities

Each these which are described in more detail below.

FOOOF follows the following Python conventions:

- all user exposed settings, data, and methods are directly accessible through the object
- 'hidden' (internal) settings and methods have a leading underscore

  - you *can* access these if you need to, but one should be cautious doing so


1) Settings (attributes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of parameters that control the FOOOF fitting algorithm, that
can be set by the user when initializing the FOOOF model.

There are some internal settings that are not exposed at initialization.
These settings are unlikely to need to be accessed by the user, but can be if desired -
they are all defined and documented in \__init\__ (there should be no other settings, or
'magic numbers' in any other parts of the code).


Controlling Peak Fits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**peak_width_limits (Hz)** default: [0.5, 12]

Enforced limits on the minimum and maximum widths of extracted peaks, given as a list of
[minimum bandwidth, maximum bandwidth]. We recommend bandwidths be set to be at last twice
the frequency resolution of the power spectrum.


Peak Search Stopping Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An iterative procedure searches for candidate peaks in the flattened spectrum. Candidate
peaks are extracted in order of decreasing height, until some stopping criterion is met,
which is controlled by the following parameters:

**max_n_peaks (int)** default: infinite

The maximum number of peaks that can be extracted from a given power spectrum. FOOOF will
halt searching for new peaks when this number is reached. Note that FOOOF extracts peaks
iteratively by height (over and above the aperiodic component), and so this approach will
extract (up to) the *n* largest peaks.

**peak_threshold (in units of standard deviation)** default: 2.0

The threshold, in terms of standard deviation of the aperiodic-removed power
spectrum, above which a data point must pass to be considered a candidate peak.
Once a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak search is halted (without
including the most recent candidate).

**min_peak_height (units of power - same as the input spectrum)** default: 0

The minimum height, above the aperiodic fit, that a peak must have to be extracted
in the initial fit stage. Once a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak
search is halted (without including the most recent candidate). Note that because
this constraint is enforced during peak search, and prior to final peak fit, returned
peaks are not guaranteed to surpass this value in height.

Note: there are two different height-related halting conditions for the peak searching.
By default, the relative (standard-deviation based) threshold is defined, whereas the
absolute threshold is set to zero (this default is because there is no general way to
set this value without knowing the scale of the data). If both are defined, both are
used and the peak search will halt when a candidate peak fails to pass either the absolute,
or relative threshold.

Aperiodic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**aperiodic_mode (string)** default='fixed'

The fitting approach to use for the aperiodic component.

Options:
  - 'fixed' : fits without a knee parameter (with the knee parameter 'fixed' at 0)
  - 'knee' : fits the full exponential equation, including the 'knee' parameter

Verbosity
~~~~~~~~~

**verbose (boolean)** default='True'

Whether to print out status updates and warnings.

    ==================================================================================================




Changing FOOOF Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that if you wish to change settings, then you should re-initialize
the FOOOF object with new settings.

Simply changing the value of the relevant attribute may not appropriately propagate
the value, and thus may lead to a failure, either creating an error, or not applying
the settings properly during fit and returning erroneous results.

Here we will re-initialize a new FOOOF object, with some new settings.



.. code-block:: default


    # Re-initialize a new FOOOF model, with some specified settings
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_height=0.15)








2) Data (attributes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FOOOF stores the following data attributes:

- `freqs`: the frequency values corresponding to the data
- `power_spectrum`: the power spectrum
- `freq_range`: the frequency range of the data
- `freq_res`: the frequency resolution of the data

During the fit procedure, interim (hidden) data variables are also created and used.

The FOOOF object also has an indicator attribute, `has_data` which indicates
if the current object has data loaded.



.. code-block:: default


    # Load a piece of example data
    freqs = np.load('data/freqs_2.npy')
    spectrum = np.load('data/spectrum_2.npy')









.. code-block:: default


    # Set a frequency range and add the data to the FOOOF object
    freq_range = [2, 40]
    fm.add_data(freqs, spectrum, freq_range)









.. code-block:: default


    # Check if the FOOOF object has data loaded
    print('Has model results: ', fm.has_data)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Has model results:  True





.. code-block:: default


    # Check out the data attributes in the FOOOF object
    print('Frequency Range: \t', fm.freq_range)
    print('Frequency Resolution: \t', fm.freq_res)
    print('Frequency Values: \t', fm.freqs[0:5])
    print('Power Values: \t\t', fm.power_spectrum[0:5])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Frequency Range:         [2.441406250001353, 39.55078125002192]
    Frequency Resolution:    0.48828125000027045
    Frequency Values:        [2.44140625 2.9296875  3.41796875 3.90625    4.39453125]
    Power Values:            [-21.99921865 -21.99669556 -22.02605736 -21.96875308 -22.15436702]




Now that we have picked our settings, and added the data, let's fit our FOOOF model.



.. code-block:: default


    # Fit FOOOF model to the loaded data
    fm.fit()








3) Results (attributes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With our model fit, the results attributes should now hold values.

Recall that FOOOF follows the scipy convention in that any attributes that contain
model results are indicated by a trailing underscore.

The model results stored by the object are:

- `aperiodic\_params_`: a list of aperiodic parameters, stored as [Offset, (Knee), Exponent]
- `peak\_params\_`: all periodic parameters, where each row is a peak, as [CF, PW, BW]
- `r\_squared\_`: the r-squared of the model, as compared to the original data
- `error\_`: the error of the model, as compared to the original data

Other attributes which store outputs from the model are:

- `fooofed\_spectrum\_`: the full model reconstruction
- `n\_peaks\_`: a helper attribute which indicates how many peaks were fit in the model

The FOOOF object also has an indicator attribute, `has_model` which indicates
if the current object has model results available.



.. code-block:: default


    # Check if the FOOOF object has model results
    print('Has model results: ', fm.has_model)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Has model results:  True





.. code-block:: default


    # Print out model fit results
    print('aperiodic params: \t', fm.aperiodic_params_)
    print('peak params: \t',fm.peak_params_)
    print('r-squared: \t', fm.r_squared_)
    print('fit error: \t', fm.error_)
    print('fooofed spectrum: \t',fm.fooofed_spectrum_[0:5])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

4) Methods
^^^^^^^^^^

The FOOOF object contains a number of methods that are either used to fit
models and access data, and/or offer extra functionality.

In addition to the exposed methods, there are some internal private methods,
with a leading underscore in their name, that are called in the
fitting procedure. These methods should not be called directly by the user
as they may depend on internal state of the object as defined from other methods,
and so may not do as expected in isolation.



.. code-block:: default


    # This piece of code is just a way to print out all the public methods with their description
    [print(it + '\n\t' + eval('fm.' + it + '.__doc__').split('\n')[0]) \
     for it in dir(fm) if it[0] != '_' and callable(eval('fm.' + it))];

Saving Data & Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOOOF also has support for saving out, and loading back in, data and results.

You have the option to specify which data to save.

- results: model fit results (same as is returned in FOOOFResult)
- settings: all public settings (everything available at initialization)
- data: freqs & power spectrum

FOOOF saves data out to JSON files. You can specify a file name to save
or append to, or pass in a JSON file object.



.. code-block:: default


    # Saving FOOOF results, settings, and data
    fm.save('FOOOF_results', save_results=True, save_settings=True, save_data=True)









.. code-block:: default


    # Loading FOOOF results
    nfm = FOOOF()
    nfm.load('FOOOF_results')









.. code-block:: default


    # Plot loaded results
    nfm.plot()




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_04-MoreFOOOF_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Creating Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOOOF also has functionality to save out a 'report' of a particular model fit.

This generates and saves a PDF which contains the same output as
'print_results', 'plot', and 'print_settings'.



.. code-block:: default


    # Save out a report of the current FOOOF model fit & results
    #  By default (with no inputs) this saves a PDF to current directory, with the name 'FOOOF_Report'
    #    Add inputs to the method call to specify a file-name, and save-location
    fm.save_report('FOOOF_report')









.. code-block:: default


    # If you're in a notebook, you can use this code to check what the generated report looks like
    from IPython.display import IFrame
    IFrame("FOOOF_report.pdf", width=950, height=1200)






.. only:: builder_html

    .. raw:: html


                <iframe
                    width="950"
                    height="1200"
                    src="FOOOF_report.pdf"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allowfullscreen
                ></iframe>
        
        <br />
        <br />

Conclusion
----------

We have now fully explored the FOOOF model object, and all it contains. Next,
we will take a deeper dive into how to choose different modes for fitting
the aperiodic component of power spectra.
