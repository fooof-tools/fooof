01: Model Description
=====================


This tutorial provides a theoretical / mathematical description
of the FOOOF model and parameters.



Introduction
------------

A neural power spectrum is fit as a combination of an aperiodic signal and periodic oscillations.

The aperiodic component of the signal displays 1/f like properties.

Putative oscillations (hereafter referred to as 'peaks'), are frequency regions
in which there are 'bumps' of power over and above the aperiodic signal.

This formulation roughly translates to fitting the power spectrum as:

.. math::
   P = L + \sum_{n=0}^{N} G_n

Where `P` is the power spectrum, `L` is the aperiodic signal, and each :math:`G_n`
is a Gaussian fit to a peak, for `N` total peaks extracted from the power spectrum.



Aperiodic Fit
-------------

The aperiodic fit uses an exponential function, fit on the semilog power spectrum
(linear frequencies and :math:`log_{10}` power values).

The exponential is of the form:

.. math::
   L = 10^b * \frac{1}{(k + F^\chi)}

Or, equivalently:

.. math::
   L = b - \log(k + F^\chi)

In this formulation, the parameters `b`, `k`, and :math:`\chi`
define the aperiodic signal, as:

- `b` is the broadband 'offset'
- `k` relates to the 'knee'
- :math:`\chi` is the 'exponent' of the aperiodic fit
- `F` is the vector of input frequencies

Note that fitting the knee parameter is optional. If used, the knee defines a bend in the
aperiodic `1/f` like component of the signal.

By default the aperiodic signal is fit with the 'knee' parameter set to zero.
This fits the aperiodic signal equivalently to fitting a linear fit in log-log space.

Broader frequency ranges typically do not display a single 1/f like characteristic,
and so for these cases fitting with the knee parameter allows for modelling bends
in the aperiodic signal.



Peaks
-----

Regions of power over above this aperiodic signal, as defined above, are considered
to be putative oscillations and are fit in the model by a Gaussian.

For each Gaussian, :math:`G_n`, with the form:

.. math::
   G_n = a * exp (\frac{- (F - c)^2}{2 * w^2})

Each peak is defined in terms of parameters `a`, `c` and `w`, where:

- `a` is the amplitude of the peak, over and above the aperiodic signal
- `c` is the center frequency of the peak
- `w` is the width of the peak
- `F` is the vector of input frequencies

The full power spectrum fit is therefore the combination of the aperiodic fit,
`L` defined by the exponential fit, and `N` peaks, where each :math:`G_n` is
formalized as a Gaussian process.

This procedure is able to create a model of the neural power spectrum,
 that is fully described mathematical by the mathematical model from above:
