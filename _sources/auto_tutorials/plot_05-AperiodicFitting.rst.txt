05: Aperiodic Component Fitting
===============================


This tutorials covers how to choose and use different approaches for
fitting the aperiodic component of the signal.




.. code-block:: python


    # Import numpy for loading data, and FOOOF object
    import numpy as np
    from fooof import FOOOF







Aperiodic Fitting Approaches
----------------------------

FOOOF currently offers two approaches for fitting the aperiodic component:

- Fitting with just an offset and a exponent, equivalent to a linear fit in log-log space

  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'fixed'
- Including a 'knee' parameter, reflecting a fit with a bend, in log-log space

  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'knee'

Fitting in the 'fixed' mode assumes a single 1/f like characteristic to the aperiodic
signal, meaning it looks linear across all frequencies in log-log space.

Though this assumption is true across *some* frequency ranges in neural data, it does
does not hold up across broad freequency ranges. If fitting is done in the 'fixed' mode,
but the assumption of a single 1/f is violated, then fitting will go wrong.

Broad frequency ranges (typically ranges greater than ~40 Hz range) don't meet this
criterion, as they typically exhibit a 'bend' in the aperiodic signal, whereby there is
not a single 1/f property across all frequencies, but rather a 'bend' in the aperiodic
component. For these cases, fitting should be done using an extra parameter to capture
this, in 'knee' mode.



Fitting FOOOF with Aperiodic 'Knee'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




.. code-block:: python


    # Load example data (LFP)
    freqs = np.load('dat/freqs_lfp.npy')
    spectrum = np.load('dat/spectrum_lfp.npy')








.. code-block:: python


    # Initialize FOOOF - setting to aperiodic mode to use a knee fit
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[2, 8], aperiodic_mode='knee')








.. code-block:: python


    # Fit FOOOF model
    #  Note that this time we're specifying an optional parameter to plot in log-log
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum, [2, 60], plt_log=True)

A note on interpreting the "knee" parameter
-------------------------------------------

The aperiodic fit has the form:

.. math::
   AP = 10^b * \ \frac{1}{(k + F^\chi)}

The knee parameter reported above corresponds to `k` in the equation.

This parameter is dependent on the frequency at which the aperiodic fit
transitions from horizontal to negatively sloped.

To interpret this parameter as a frequency, take the :math:`\chi`-th root of `k`, i.e.:

.. math::
   knee \ frequency = k^{1/\ \chi}

Interpreting the fit results when using knee fits is more complex, as the exponent result is
no longer a simple measure of the aperiodic component as a whole, but instead reflects the
aperiodic component past the 'knee' inflecting point. Becaues of this, when doing knee fits,
knee & exponent values should be considered together.



Choosing an Aperiodic Fitting Procedure
---------------------------------------

It is important to choose the appropriate aperiodic fitting approach for your data.

If there is a clear knee in the power spectrum, fitting in 'fixed' mode
will not work well. However fitting FOOOF with knee fits may perform sub-optimally
in ambiguous cases (where the data may or may not have a knee), or if no knee is present.

Given this, we recommend:

- Check your data, across the frequency range of interest,
  for what the aperiodic signal looks like.

  - If it looks roughly linear (in log-log space), fit without a knee.

    - This is likely across smaller frequency ranges, such as 3-30.
    - Do not perform no-knee fits across a range in which this does not hold.
  - If there is a clear knee, then use knee fits.

    - This is likely across larger fitting ranges such as 1-150 Hz.
- Be wary of ambiguous ranges, where there may or may not be a knee.

  - Trying to fit without a knee, when there is not a single consistent aperiodic signal,
    can lead to very bad fits. But it is also a known issue that trying to fit with a knee
    can lead to suboptimal fits when no knee is present.

    - We therefore currently recommend picking frequency ranges in which the expected
      aperiodic signal process is relatively clear.
