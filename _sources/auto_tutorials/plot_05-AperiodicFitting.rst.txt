05: Aperiodic Component Fitting
===============================

Choosing and using different approaches for fitting the aperiodic component.

Aperiodic Fitting Approaches
----------------------------

FOOOF currently offers two approaches for fitting the aperiodic component:

- Fitting with just an offset and a exponent, equivalent to a linear fit in log-log space

  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'fixed'
- Including a 'knee' parameter, reflecting a fit with a bend, in log-log space

  - `aperiodic_mode` = 'knee'

Fitting in the 'fixed' mode assumes a single 1/f like characteristic to the aperiodic
component, meaning it looks linear across all frequencies in log-log space.

Though this assumption is true across *some* frequency ranges in neural data, it does
does not hold up across broad frequency ranges. If fitting is done in the 'fixed' mode,
but the assumption of a single 1/f is violated, then fitting will go wrong.

Broad frequency ranges (typically ranges greater than ~40 Hz range) don't meet this
criterion, as they typically exhibit a 'bend' in the aperiodic component, whereby there is
not a single 1/f property across all frequencies, but rather a 'bend' in the aperiodic
component. For these cases, fitting should be done using an extra parameter to capture
this, in 'knee' mode.


Fitting FOOOF with Aperiodic 'Knee'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's explore fitting FOOOF across a broader frequency range,
using some local field potential data.



.. code-block:: default


    # Load example data
    freqs = np.load('data/freqs_lfp.npy')
    spectrum = np.load('data/spectrum_lfp.npy')









.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize FOOOF, setting the aperiodic mode to use a knee fit
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[2, 8], aperiodic_mode='knee')









.. code-block:: default


    # Fit FOOOF model
    #  Note that this time we're specifying an optional parameter to plot in log-log
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum, [2, 70], plt_log=True)

A note on interpreting the "knee" parameter
-------------------------------------------

The aperiodic fit has the form:

.. math::
   AP = 10^b * \ \frac{1}{(k + F^\chi)}

The knee parameter reported above corresponds to `k` in the equation.

This parameter is dependent on the frequency at which the aperiodic fit
transitions from horizontal to negatively sloped.

To interpret this parameter as a frequency, take the :math:`\chi`-th root of `k`, i.e.:

.. math::
   knee \ frequency = k^{1/\ \chi}

Interpreting the fit results when using knee fits is more complex, as the exponent result is
no longer a simple measure of the aperiodic component as a whole, but instead reflects the
aperiodic component past the 'knee' inflecting point. Because of this, when doing knee fits,
knee & exponent values should be considered together.


Example: Aperiodic Fitting Gone Wrong
-------------------------------------

In the example above, we jumped directly to fitting with a knee.

Here we will explore what it looks like if we don't use the appropriate mode for fitting
the aperiodic component - fitting in 'fixed' mode when we should use 'knee'



.. code-block:: default


    # Create and fit a FOOOF model in fixed mode to the same data as above
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[2, 8], aperiodic_mode='fixed')
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum, [2, 70], plt_log=True)

    ==================================================================================================




In this case, we see that the 'fixed' aperiodic component (equivalent to a line
in log-log space) is not able to capture the data, which has a curve.

To compensate, the model adds extra peaks, but these are also not a good
characterization of the data.

In this example, the data, over this frequency range, needs to be fit in
'knee' mode to be able to appropriately characterize the data.


Choosing an Aperiodic Fitting Procedure
---------------------------------------

It is important to choose the appropriate aperiodic fitting approach for your data.

If there is a clear knee in the power spectrum, fitting in 'fixed' mode
will not work well. However fitting FOOOF with knee fits may perform sub-optimally
in ambiguous cases (where the data may or may not have a knee), or if no knee is present.

Given this, we recommend:

- Check your data, across the frequency range of interest,
  for what the aperiodic component looks like.

  - If it looks roughly linear (in log-log space), fit without a knee.

    - This is likely across smaller frequency ranges, such as 3-30.
    - Do not perform no-knee fits across a range in which this does not hold.
  - If there is a clear knee, then use knee fits.

    - This is likely across larger fitting ranges such as 1-150 Hz.
- Be wary of ambiguous ranges, where there may or may not be a knee.

  - Trying to fit without a knee, when there is not a single consistent aperiodic component,
    can lead to very bad fits. But it is also a known issue that trying to fit with a knee
    can lead to suboptimal fits when no knee is present.

    - We therefore currently recommend picking frequency ranges in which the expected
      aperiodic component process is relatively clear.


Conclusion
----------

Now that we have explored the FOOOF object, and different fitting approaches
for fitting the aperiodic component. Next up, we will continue be introducing
how to scale the fitting to apply across multiple power spectra.
