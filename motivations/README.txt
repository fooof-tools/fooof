Motivations
===========

This section explores conceptual and methodological ideas that motivate parameterizing neural power spectra. 

Using code examples, topics are organized into:

- conceptual points about approaches for analyzing neural data and related topics in digital signal processing
- methodological points investigating if and how current approaches may conflate different aspects of the data

These examples can be explored in any order.
