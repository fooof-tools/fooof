class SpectralFitAlgorithm():
    """Base object defining model & algorithm for spectral parameterization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    % public settings described in `SpectralModel`
    _ap_percentile_thresh : float
        Percentile threshold, to select points from a flat spectrum for an initial aperiodic fit
        Points are selected at a low percentile value to restrict to non-peak points.
    _ap_guess : list of [float, float, float]
        Guess parameters for fitting the aperiodic component, as [offset, knee, exponent].
        If offset guess is None, the first value of the power spectrum is used as offset guess
        If exponent guess is None, the abs(log-log slope) of first & last points is used
    _ap_bounds : tuple of tuple of float
        Bounds for aperiodic fitting, as: ((offset_low_bound, knee_low_bound, exp_low_bound),
                                           (offset_high_bound, knee_high_bound, exp_high_bound))
        By default, aperiodic fitting is unbound, but can be restricted here.
        Even if fitting without knee, leave bounds for knee (they are dropped later).
    _cf_bound : float
        Parameter bounds for center frequency when fitting gaussians, in terms of +/- std dev.
    _bw_std_edge : float
        Threshold for how far a peak has to be from edge to keep.
        This is defined in units of gaussian standard deviation.
    _gauss_overlap_thresh : float
        Degree of overlap between gaussian guesses for one to be dropped.
        This is defined in units of gaussian standard deviation.
    _maxfev : int
        The maximum number of calls to the curve fitting function.
    _tol : float
        The tolerance setting for curve fitting (see scipy.curve_fit - ftol / xtol / gtol).
        The default value reduce tolerance to speed fitting (as compared to curve_fit's default).
        Set value to 1e-8 to match curve_fit default
    _error_metric : str
        The error metric to use for post-hoc measures of model fit error.
        Note: this is for checking error post fitting, not an objective function for fitting.
        See `_calc_error` for options.
    _debug : bool
        Run mode: whether the object is set in debug mode.
        If in debug mode, an error is raised if model fitting is unsuccessful.
        This should be controlled by using the `set_debug_mode` method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _gauss_std_limits : list of [float, float]
        Settings attribute: peak width limits, to use for gaussian standard deviation parameter.
        This attribute is computed based on `peak_width_limits` and should not be updated directly.
    _spectrum_flat : 1d array
        Data attribute: flattened power spectrum, with the aperiodic component removed.
    _spectrum_peak_rm : 1d array
        Data attribute: power spectrum, with peaks removed.
    _ap_fit : 1d array
        Model attribute: values of the isolated aperiodic fit.
    _peak_fit : 1d array
        Model attribue: values of the isolated peak fit.
